/* To make complex assignments a bit safer, in particular with
   reference counting, a bit is set on the LHS binding cell or symbol
   at the beginning of the complex assignment process and unset at the
   end.

   - When the assignment bit is set and a new value is assigned to the
     binding then the reference count on the old value is not
     decremented. This prevents moving a single binding from the LHS
     variable of the assignment to another variable during the
     assignment process.

  - If a complex assignment tries to update a binding that already has
    its bit set then, the value of the binding is shallow-duplicated
    before proceeding. This ensures that the structure involved in the
    original complex assignment will not be mutated by further R level
    assignments during the original assignment process.

  For now, no attempt is made to unset the bit if the end of an
  assignment is not reached because of a jump. This may result in some
  unnecessary duplications. This could be prevented by maintaining a
  stack of pending assignments to resent the bits on jump, but that
  seems like overkill.

  It might also be useful to use this bit to communicate to functions
  when they are used in a getter/setter context.

  The bit used is bit 11 in the 'gp' field. An alternative would be to
  take a bit from the 'extra' field.

    /** @brief Replacement for CR's SEXPREC.
     *
     * This class is the rough equivalent within CXXR of the SEXPREC
     * union within CR.  However, all functionality relating to
     * garbage collection has been factored out into the base class
     * GCNode, and as CXXR development proceeds other functionality
     * will be factored out into derived classes (corresponding
     * roughly, but not exactly, to different ::SEXPTYPE values within
     * CR), or outside the RObject hierarchy altogether.
     *
     * Eventually this class may end up simply as the home of R
     * attributes.
     *
     * @note The word 'object' in the name of this class is used in
     * the sense in which the 'blue book' (Becker <em>et al.</em>
     * [1988]) uses the phrase 'data object'.  Roughly speaking,
     * CXXR::RObject is a base class for the sorts of data items whose
     * existence would be reported by the R function
     * <tt>objects()</tt>.  In particular, it does not imply that
     * the object belongs to an R class.
     *
     * @invariant The class currently aims to enforce the following
     * invariants in regard to each RObject:
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li><tt>m_has_class</tt> is true iff the object has the class
     * attribute.</li>
     *
     * <li>Each attribute in the list of attributes must have a Symbol
     * as its tag.  Null tags are not allowed.</li>
     *
     * <li>Each attribute must have a distinct tag: no duplicates
     * allowed.</li>
     *
     * <li>No attribute may have a null value: an attempt to set the
     * value of an attribute to null will result in the removal of the
     * attribute altogether.
     * </ul>
     * The CR code in attrib.cpp applies further consistency
     * conditions on attributes, but these are not yet enforced via
     * the class interface.
     *
     * @par <tt>const RObject*</tt> policy:
     * There is an inherent tension between the way CR is implemented
     * and the 'const-correctness' that C++ programmers seek, and this
     * particularly arises in connection with pointers to objects of
     * classes derived from RObject.  CR accesses such objects
     * exclusively using ::SEXP, which is a non-const pointer.  (The
     * occasional use within the CR code of <tt>const SEXP</tt> is
     * misguided: the compiler interprets this in effect as
     * <tt>RObject* const</tt>, not as <tt>const RObject*</tt>.)  One
     * possible policy would be simply never to use <tt>const T*</tt>,
     * where \c T is \c RObject* or a class inheriting from it: that
     * would remove any need for <tt>const_cast</tt>s at the interface
     * between new CXXR code and code inherited from CR.  But CXXR
     * tries to move closer to C++ idiom than that, notwithstanding
     * the resulting need for <tt>const_cast</tt>s at the interface,
     * and applies a policy driven by the following considerations:
     * <ol>
     *
     * <li>RObject::evaluate() cannot return a <code>const
     * RObject*</code>, because some functions return a pointer to an
     * <code>Environment</code>, which may well need subsequently to
     * be modified e.g. by inserting or changing bindings.</li>
     *
     * <li>This in turn means that RObject::evaluate() cannot itself
     * be a <code>const</code> function, because the default
     * implementation returns <code>this</code>. (Another view would
     * be that the default implementation is an elided copy.)  Also,
     * Promise objects change internally when they are evaluated
     * (though this might conceivably be swept up by
     * <code>mutable</code>).</li>
     *
     * <li>It is a moot point whether FunctionBase::apply() can be
     * <code>const</code>.  Closure::apply() entails evaluating the
     * body, and if the body is regarded as part of the Closure
     * object, that would point to <code>apply()</code> not being
     * <code>const</code>. (Note that some of the types which
     * Rf_mkCLOSXP() accepts as a Closure body use the default
     * RObject::evaluate(), so Point&nbsp;2 definitely applies.)</li>
     *
     * <li>Should PairList objects and suchlike emulate (roughly
     * speaking) (a) <code>list&lt;pair&lt;const RObject*, const
     * RObject*&gt; &gt;</code> (where the first element of the pair
     * is the tag and the second the 'car'),
     * (b)Â <code>list&lt;pair&lt;const RObject*, RObject*&gt;
     * &gt;</code> or (c) <code>list&lt;pair&lt;RObject*, RObject*&gt;
     * &gt;</code> ? Since the 'cars' of list elements will often need
     * to be evaluated, Point 2 rules out (a).  At present CXXR
     * follows (b).</li>
     *
     * <li>Since Symbol objects may well need to be evaluated,
     * Symbol::obtain() returns a non-const pointer; similarly,
     * String::obtain() returns a non-const pointer to a
     * String object.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * @todo Incorporate further attribute consistency checks within
     * the class interface.  Possibly make setAttribute() virtual so
     * that these consistency checks can be tailored according to the
     * derived class.
