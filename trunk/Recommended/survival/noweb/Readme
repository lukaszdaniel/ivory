 Some portions of the survival package have been written using the literate
programming paradym.  These are contained here, and have a .Rnw suffix.
Long term, the plan is to have all of the code source here to maximize
the documentation, and through it the reliability of the package. 

These files are processed using the noweb package, NOT by Sweave or knitr.
The purpose of the latter two is to create reports that interweave text and
exectuted results.  The noweb package documents and writes out source code
for functions.

The result file all.pdf is documentation for understanding the code, 
not how to use the survival functions for data analysis.  For those who
maintain the code it will be a big help, for everyone else I'd expect
it to be boring.

Use ``R CMD make'' to create the documentation file.
