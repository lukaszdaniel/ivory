1. HISTORY

IVoRy (Internationalized Version Of R) is one-person experimental project focused on increasing the usage of
i18n in R. Original R already has some i18n support but still not close to 100%.

Work began since R 3.0.0 and is being continued.

This modified version of R along with its recommended packages is free
software distributed under a GNU-style copyleft.


2. CHANGES MADE TO R CORE AND RECOMMENDED PACKAGES

See 'ChangeLog' for R-core, and 'Changes' for each recommended package


3. GOALS

The aim of this project is to deliver full i18n for R and its recommended packages
while retaining its full functionality.


Best regards,
