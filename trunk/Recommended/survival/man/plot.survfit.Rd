\usage{
\method{plot}{survfit}(x, conf.int=, mark.time=TRUE, 
 mark=3, col=1, lty=1, lwd=1, cex=1, log=FALSE, xscale=1, yscale=1,

}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    an object of class \code{survfit}, usually returned by the
    \code{survfit} function. 
  }
  \item{conf.int}{
    determines whether confidence intervals will be plotted.  The default is to 
    do so if there is only 1 curve, i.e., no strata. 
  }
  \item{mark.time}{
    controls the labeling of the curves.  If set to \code{FALSE}, no
    labeling is done. 
    If \code{TRUE}, then curves are marked at each censoring time which
    is not also a death time.  If \code{mark.time} is a 
    numeric vector, then curves are marked at the specified time points. 
  }
  \item{mark}{
    vector of mark parameters, which will be used to label the curves. 
    The \code{lines} help file contains examples of the possible marks. 
    The vector is reused cyclically if it is shorter than the number of curves. 
  }
  \item{col}{
    a vector of integers specifying colors for each curve. 
    The default value is 1. 
  }
  \item{lty}{
    a vector of integers specifying line types for each curve. 
    The default value is 1. 
  }
  \item{lwd}{
    a vector of numeric values for line widths. The default value is 1. 
  }
  \item{cex}{
    a numeric value specifying the size of the marks. 
    This is not treated as a vector; all marks have the same size.
  }
  \item{log}{
    a logical value, if TRUE the y axis wll be on a log scale. 
    Alternately, one of the standard character strings "x", "y", or "xy"
    can be given to specific logarithmic horizontal and/or vertical axes.
  }
  \item{yscale}{
    a numeric value used to multiply the labels on the y axis. 
    A value of 100, for instance, would be used to give a percent scale. 
    Only the labels are 
    changed, not the actual plot coordinates, so that adding a curve with 
    "\code{lines(surv.exp(...))}", say,  
    will perform as it did without the \code{yscale} argument. 
  }
  \item{xscale}{
    a numeric value used like \code{yscale} for labels on the x axis.  
    A value of 365.25 will give labels in years instead of the original days.  
  }
  \item{firstx, firsty}{
    the starting point for the survival curves.  If either of these is set to 
    \code{NA} the plot will start at the first time point of the curve. 
    By default, the plot program obeys tradition by having the plot start at
    (0,0).

    If \code{start.time} argument is used in \code{survfit}, \code{firstx}
    is set to that value.
  }
  \item{xmax}{
    the maximum horizontal plot coordinate.  This can be used to shrink
    the range of a plot.  It shortens the curve before plotting it, so
    that unlike using the \code{xlim} graphical parameter, warning
    messages about out of bounds points are not generated.
  }
  \item{ymin}{
    lower boundary for y values.  Survival curves are most often drawn in the 
    range of 0-1, even if none of the curves approach zero. 
    The parameter is ignored if the \code{fun} argument is present,
    or if it has been set to \code{NA}. 
  }
  \item{fun}{
    an arbitrary function defining a transformation of the survival curve. 
    For example \code{fun=log} is an alternative way to draw a log-survival curve 
    (but with the axis labeled with log(S) values), 
    and \code{fun=sqrt} would generate a curve on square root scale. 
    Four often used transformations can be specified with a character 
    argument instead: \code{"log"} is the same as using the \code{log=T} option, 
    \code{"event"} plots cumulative events (f(y) = 1-y),  
    \code{"cumhaz"} plots the cumulative hazard function (f(y) = -log(y)), and 
    \code{"cloglog"} creates a complimentary log-log survival plot (f(y) = 
    log(-log(y)) along with log scale for the x-axis).  
  }
  \item{xlab}{
    label given to the x-axis. 
  }
  \item{ylab}{
    label given to the y-axis. 
  }
  \item{xaxs}{
    either \code{"S"} for a survival curve or a standard x axis style as
    listed in \code{par}.
    Survival curves are usually displayed with the curve touching the y-axis,
    but not touching the bounding box of the plot on the other 3 sides.
    Type \code{"S"} accomplishes this by manipulating the plot range and
    then using the \code{"i"} style internally.
  }
  \item{\dots}{for future methods}
}
\value{
a list with components \code{x} and \code{y}, containing the coordinates of the last point 
on each of the curves (but not the confidence limits).   
This may be useful for labeling. 
}
\description{
A plot of survival curves is produced, one curve for each strata. 
The \code{log=T} option does extra work to avoid log(0), and to try to create a 
pleasing result.  If there are zeros, they are plotted by default at 
0.8 times the smallest non-zero value on the curve(s).

Curves are plotted in the same order as they are listed by \code{print}
(which gives a 1 line summary of each).
This will be the order in which \code{col}, \code{lty}, etc are used.
}
\details{
  When the \code{survfit} function creates a multi-state survival curve
  the resulting object also has class `survfitms'.
  Competing risk curves are a common case.  The only difference in
  the plots is that multi-state defaults to a curve that goes from lower
  left to upper right (starting at 0), where survival curves by default
  start at 1 and go down.  All other options are identical.
