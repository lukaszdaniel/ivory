/* Comment formerly in memory.cpp:

   The Heap Structure.  Nodes for each generation are arranged in
   circular doubly-linked lists.  The double linking allows nodes to
   be removed in constant time; this is used by the collector to move
   reachable nodes out of free space and into the appropriate
   generation.  The circularity eliminates the need for end checks.
   In addition, each link is anchored at an artificial node called a
   peg, which simplifies pointer maintenance.  The circular
   doubly-linked arrangement is taken from Baker's in-place
   incremental collector design; see
   ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/hb/hbaker/NoMotionGC.html or the Jones and
   Lins GC book.  The linked lists are implemented by adding two
   pointer fields to the SEXPREC structure, which increases its size
   from 5 to 7 words. Other approaches are possible but don't seem
   worth pursuing for R.

    /** @brief Base class for objects managed by the garbage collector.
     *
     * Abstract base class for all objects managed by the garbage
     * collector.
     *
     * \par Derived class checklist:
     * Classes derived directly or indirectly from GCNode should do
     * the following to ensure the integrity of the garbage collection
     * scheme:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Explicitly declare a destructor (even if it does nothing)
     * as either protected or (if no further derivation from the class
     * is envisaged) private.  This ensures that objects of classes
     * derived from GCNode can be created only using 'new'.</li>
     *
     * <li>If the derived class contains any pointers or references to
     * other objects derived from GCNode, it should reimplement the
     * method visitChildren() appropriately.</li>
     *
     * <li>If the derived class contains any pointers to other objects
     * derived from GCNode, then any post-construction operation that
     * modifies the pointer must invoke the method propagateAge() with
     * that no old-to-new references arise.  There is no need to do
     * no old-to-new references arise.  There is no need to do this
     * this during the operation of a constructor for the derived
     * class, because then the object under construction will
     * necessarily be newer than anything to which it refers.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * \par Infant immunity:
     * While a GCNode or an object of a class derived from GCNode is
     * under construction, it is effectively immune from the garbage
     * collector.  Not only does this greatly simplify the coding of
     * the constructors themselves, it also means that in implementing
     * the virtual method visitChildren(), it is not necessary to
     * consider the possibility that the garbage collector will invoke
     * this method for a node whose construction is not yet complete.
     *
     * \par
     * The method expose() is used to end this immunity once
     * construction of an object is complete.  However, there appears
     * to be no clean and general way in C++ of calling expose() \e
     * exactly when construction is complete.  Consequently, a node
     * N's infant immunity will in fact continue until one of the
     * following events occurs:
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>The method expose() is called explicitly for N, or for a
     * node that refers to N (and so on recursively).</li>
     *
     * <li>N is visited by a \b GCNode::Ager object (as part of write
     * barrier enforcement).  This will happen if a node that is
     * already exposed to the garbage collector is modified so that it
     * refers to N (or a node that refers to N, and so on
     * recursively).</li>
     *
     * <li>A pointer to N (or a node that refers to N, and so on
     * recursively) is specified in the constructor of a GCRoot
     * object, and the optional argument \a expose is set to
     * true.</li>
     *
     * <li>N is designated as the key, value or R finalizer of a weak
     * reference object.</li>
     *
     * <li>N is itself a weak reference object (in which case it is
     * exposed to garbage collection during construction).</li>
     *
     * </ul>
     * 
     * \par
     * It is the responsibility of any code that creates an object of
     * a class derived from GCNode to ensure that, under normal
     * operation, the object is in due course exposed to the garbage
     * collector.  However, if exceptions occur, the static member
     * function slaughterInfants() can be used to delete \e all the
     * nodes currently enjoying infant immunity.
     *
     * \par Nested <tt>new</tt>:
     * Consider the following code to create a PairList of two
     * elements, with \c first as the 'car' of the first element and
     * \c second as the 'car' of the second element:
     * \code
     * CXXR::GCRoot<CXXR::PairList>
     *   pl2(new CXXR::PairList(first, new CXXR::PairList(second)));
     * \endcode
     * Is this code sound?  You might suppose that there is a risk
     * that the second element of the list will be garbage-collected
     * when \c new is invoked to allocate space for the first element.
     * But this is not so: at this stage, the second element will
     * still enjoy infant immunity.
     *
     * \par
     * However, a potential problem arises from a different quarter.
     * Suppose that the \c new to allocate space for the second
     * element succeeds, but that the \c new to allocate space for the
     * first element fails because of shortage of memory, and throws
     * <tt>std::bad_alloc</tt>.  Then the second element will not be
     * exposed to the garbage collector, and the space it occupies is
     * potentially lost.  An easy workaround is for the handler that
     * catches the exception to invoke slaughterInfants().
     *
     * @note Because this base class is used purely for housekeeping
     * by the garbage collector, and does not contribute to the
     * 'meaning' of an object of a derived class, all of its data
     * members are mutable.
     *
     * @todo The (private) cleanup() method needs to address the
     * possibility that derived classes may have destructors that
     * release some external resource (e.g. a lock).  Maybe a garbage
     * collection without a 'mark' phase would do the trick.
