/* Comment formerly in memory.cpp:

   The Heap Structure.  Nodes for each generation are arranged in
   circular doubly-linked lists.  The double linking allows nodes to
   be removed in constant time; this is used by the collector to move
   reachable nodes out of free space and into the appropriate
   generation.  The circularity eliminates the need for end checks.
   In addition, each link is anchored at an artificial node called a
   peg, which simplifies pointer maintenance.  The circular
   doubly-linked arrangement is taken from Baker's in-place
   incremental collector design; see
   ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/hb/hbaker/NoMotionGC.html or the Jones and
   Lins GC book.  The linked lists are implemented by adding two
   pointer fields to the SEXPREC structure, which increases its size
   from 5 to 7 words. Other approaches are possible but don't seem
   worth pursuing for R.

    /** @brief Base class for objects managed by the garbage collector.
     *
     * Abstract base class for all objects managed by the garbage
     * collector.
     *
     * \par Derived class checklist:
     * Classes derived directly or indirectly from GCNode should do
     * the following to ensure the integrity of the garbage collection
     * scheme:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Explicitly declare a destructor (even if it does nothing)
     * as either protected or (if no further derivation from the class
     * is envisaged) private.  This ensures that objects of classes
     * derived from GCNode can be created only using 'new'.</li>
     *
     * <li>If the derived class contains any pointers or references to
     * other objects derived from GCNode, it should reimplement the
     * methods visitChildren() appropriately.</li>
     *
     * <li>If the derived class contains any pointers to other objects
     * derived from GCNode, then any post-construction operation that
     * modifies the pointer must invoke the method devolveAge() with the
     * new destination of the pointer as its argument, to ensure that
     * no old-to-new references arise.  There is no need to do this
     * during the operation of a constructor for the derived class,
     * because then the object under construction will necessarily be
     * newer than anything to which it refers.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * \par Infant immunity:
     * While a GCNode or an object of a class derived from GCNode is
     * under construction, it is effectively immune from the garbage
     * collector.  Not only does this greatly simplify the coding of
     * the constructors themselves, it also means that in implementing
     * the virtual methods visitChildren(), it is not necessary to
     * consider the possibility that the garbage collector will invoke
     * this method for a node whose construction is not yet complete.
     *
     * \par
     * The private method expose() is used to end this immunity once
     * construction of an object is complete.  However, there appears
     * to be no clean and general way in C++ of calling expose() \e
     * exactly when construction is complete.  Consequently, a node's
     * infant immunity will in fact continue until one of the
     * following events occurs:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The node is explicitly protected from the garbage
     * collector, either by encapsulating a pointer to it in a
     * GCRoot, or by the CR PROTECT() mechanism.  For this reason, it
     * is important that constructors <em>do not</em> attempt
     * explicitly to protect '<tt>this</tt>'; a particular risk with
     * this is that constructors of derived classes will not be able
     * to rely on infant immunity.</li>
     *
     * <li>The node is marked by the garbage collector.</li>
     *
     * <li>The node is visited by a \b GCNode::Ager object (as part of
     * write barrier enforcement).</li>
     *
     * <li>The (protected) method expose() is called explicitly.
     * </ul>
     *
     * \par
     * It is the responsibility of any code that creates an object of
     * a class derived from GCNode to ensure that the object is in due
     * course exposed to the garbage collector <em>even when
     * exceptions occur</em>.  A very general way of ensuring this is,
     * immediately after the object is created, to encapsulating a
     * pointer to it in a GCRoot smart pointer.
     *
     * \par Avoid nested <tt>new</tt>:
     * Consider the following code to create a PairList of two
     * elements, with \c first as the 'car' of the first element and
     * \c second as the 'car' of the second element:
     * \code
     * CXXR::GCRoot<CXXR::PairList>
     *   pl2(new CXXR::PairList(first, new CXXR::PairList(second)));
     * \endcode
     * Is this code sound?  You might suppose that there is a risk
     * that the second element of the list will be garbage-collected
     * when \c new is invoked to allocate space for the first element.
     * But this is not so: at this stage, the second element will
     * still enjoy infant immunity, which in fact it will continue to
     * enjoy until the first garbage collection after
     * <tt>pl2</tt>'s constructor has run.
     *
     * \par
     * The problem arises from a different quarter.  Suppose that the
     * \c new to allocate space for the second element succeeds, but
     * that the \c new to allocate space for the first element fails
     * because of shortage of memory, and throws
     * <tt>std::bad_alloc</tt>.  Then the space allocated to the
     * second element will be lost, because this element will never be
     * exposed to the garbage collector.  To avoid this, the preferred
     * coding approach is as follows:
     * \code
     * CXXR::GCRoot<CXXR::PairList> pl(new CXXR::PairList(second));
     * CXXR::GCRoot<CXXR::PairList> pl2(new CXXR::PairList(first, pl));
     * \endcode
     * 
     * @note Because this base class is used purely for housekeeping
     * by the garbage collector, and does not contribute to the
     * 'meaning' of an object of a derived class, its data members are
     * mutable.
     *
     * @todo The (private) cleanup() method needs to address the
     * possibility that derived classes may have destructors that
     * release some external resource (e.g. a lock).  Maybe a garbage
     * collection without a 'mark' phase would do the trick.
